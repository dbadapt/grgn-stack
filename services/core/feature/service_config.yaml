# Feature Flag App Configuration
app:
  name: feature
  domain: core
  description: Hierarchical feature flag system with A/B testing support

dependencies:
  - core/shared
  - core/identity  # For createdBy user references

features:
  boolean_flags: true
  multivariate_flags: true
  percentage_rollouts: true
  targeting_rules: true
  hierarchical_overrides: true

# Schema notes for SDK implementers:
# - Flags are evaluated by scope hierarchy: APP > TENANT > DOMAIN > GLOBAL
# - Percentage rollouts use deterministic hashing with salt for consistency
# - Targeting rules within a segment use AND logic (all must match)
# - Override segments are evaluated by priority (lower number = higher priority)
